# semanaOmniStack11
bootcamp web mobile dev - Node, React

I have been paying attention to some Youtube channels related to IT, specifically in cloud providers, app development, testing.

One that I found very interesting opportunity to stretch coding skills by following instructor was the one offered by Rocketseat.

I have been thinking that UI development would be a steep curve to climb in case I would start exploring - i have tried sometimes 
to follow similar kind of offering in Java, but in the middle of the path, I had come across with issues that had blocked my 
progress, nor found assistance or was able to find info in forum or FAQ to overcome them and go forward; finally, unhappily, I had
to give up.

As the proposal of offering was working in interesting themes that I had heard before but never had gone deeper (and had wish to know
how is it - Node.js, React Native, and a myriad of products and platform to support developing/testing processes), I decided to spend
time to follow it. 

It was not easy - the pace of classes were fast well explained enough, there were some parts near the end that i got myself stuck, I have
lost the first deadline of video instructions - i had almost given up again, but as deadline was stretched for a week more, I could land 
my project up to this project 'semanaOmniStack11' in GIT.

The bootcamp of 1 week was to build up a project with a website and mobile app to raise donation for a ficticious NGO for stray pets 
assistance.

Wow!!! What a dynamic bootcamp! at least for me - an individual that have been working with computer programming since the mainframes!
VisualStudio Code with Add-ons, SQLLite for CRUDS, Node, React Native, React JS, Javascript, assynchronous APIs, and many more!

Besides de opportunity to follow the instructor of this bootcamp, I would like to highlight the joy of getting contact with the currently
used UI tools and frameworks, to see by myself the results that I could generate in my own Androd mobile interacting with the app i could 
code together in the bootcamp!! 

It was like taking a flight up to see from above how microservices and API empowers solutions of Big data applications, among solutions 
hosted in cloud, Mainframes and other environments that can join in the mesh of connnections.

Congrats RocketSeat! special thanks to Filipe Deschamps.
